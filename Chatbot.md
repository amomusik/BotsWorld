# Responsive Personality Design in Chatbots


4 different Conversational User Interfaces that I wanted to explore, each with increasing level of visual interactivity.

* Voice Only 
* Text Only 
* Simple UI — buttons or other very simple UI elements
* Rich UI — image carousels, actionable UI elements (payments, etc)

## Voice

# Choosing Technologies Is The 3rd Step Of a Bot Project
1. **Identify the right use case** and the right scope with your client : sometime projects are not feasible technically, not really useful, or even too expensive. Don’t hesitate to start small and scale up !
2. **Design the conversation flows** (you can use RealtimeBoard a great collaborative mindmapping tool, or BotMock)
3. Choose the most appropriate **tech stack**
4. **Develop** in agile methodology using sprints, test with beta-users, improve the bot flow, the knowledge base, the bot personality…
5. **Scale up**, follow **analytics/KPI** and compare to objectives you want to achieve


How To Explain The Technologies Powering a Chatbot?

* Users interact through a **device** on a **messaging platform**, his message is processed through **NLP**.
* Then the bot can launch an **action**, answer with realtime information from a **database/API, or handover to a human**.
* The more message he receives, the more the bot improves : it’s called **machine learning**. Sometime a human helps the bot, it’s called **supervised learning**.

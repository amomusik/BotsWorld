# Responsive Personality Design in Chatbots


4 different Conversational User Interfaces that I wanted to explore, each with increasing level of visual interactivity.

* Voice Only 
* Text Only 
* Simple UI — buttons or other very simple UI elements
* Rich UI — image carousels, actionable UI elements (payments, etc)

## Voice

# Choosing Technologies Is The 3rd Step Of a Bot Project
1. **Identify the right use case** and the right scope with your client : sometime projects are not feasible technically, not really useful, or even too expensive. Don’t hesitate to start small and scale up !
2. **Design the conversation flows** (you can use RealtimeBoard a great collaborative mindmapping tool, or BotMock)
3. Choose the most appropriate **tech stack**
4. **Develop** in agile methodology using sprints, test with beta-users, improve the bot flow, the knowledge base, the bot personality…
5. **Scale up**, follow **analytics/KPI** and compare to objectives you want to achieve


How To Explain The Technologies Powering a Chatbot?
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*BVBQ-uiAOYB9LthbSoiUUA.png


* Users interact through a **device** on a **messaging platform**, his message is processed through **NLP**.
* Then the bot can launch an **action**, answer with realtime information from a **database/API, or handover to a human**.
* The more message he receives, the more the bot improves : it’s called **machine learning**. Sometime a human helps the bot, it’s called **supervised learning**.

19 Best UX Practices for Building Chatbots
1. Strive for consistency: don’t create expectations that the chatbot can’t meet.
2. Strive for consistency: provide a way back to the “main menu” somehow.
3. Until it becomes an established practice, don’t rely on Facebook’s persistent menu.
4. Don’t make the users go tl;dr.
5. Test your chatbot on different devices to make sure users are not scrolling to read.
6. Consistency: the key to making users feel safe to explore.
7. If you must redirect users out of Messenger, Use webviews.
8. Make your redirects relevant.
9. Use UI components as “guard rails” in a conversation.
10. Know that buttons and quick replies give an illusion of limited choices.
11. Be aware of the context of your messages.
12. Wording matters: clarity over elegance.
13. Wording matters: confirm by asking, not stating.
14. Wording matters: the response will follow the question.
15. Don’t leave the user hanging.
16. Undo and cancel as a functionality.
17. Give opportunities to fix misunderstandings consistently throughout the interactions.
18. Don’t display important texts as captions, and be mindful of pre-existing conventions.
19. Keep your humor safe and professional.

# 11 More Best UX Practices for Building Chatbots
1. Your chatbot needs a voice.
2. Be conscientious of how the representation of your chatbot affects the user experience.
3. Increase wait time with each additional message to give users time to read.
4. Make sure buttons are functional at all points of the conversation.
5. Learn when it is appropriate to employ quick replies or buttons.
6. Write quick replies from a first-person perspective—that is, as a user would respond.
7. Learn to say “no” tactfully, for the users’ sake.
8. If you‘re asking for a text input after using quick replies, remind the user to type.
9. Craft clever responses to cover all ground.
10. Prune your branches: Linear navigation is superior to nested navigation for conversational interfaces.
11. Provide a way to reengage the chatbot when your interaction is over.

How to Document Chatbot Requirements

Conversation Flow
	conversation flow is a dialog tree.



# How to design conversation flow:
* **Consider on-boarding.** Decide how your chatbot starts its dialog and what kind of options it gives to your users.
* **Sketch a flow chart.** Create the flow for every task user can accomplish talking to you bot.
* **Pay attention to triggers.** Work on the most important part of conversation flow — conditional triggers that split the flow depending on user replies and actions.
* **Think about error handling.** Make sure your chatbot can handle any user input and suggest the kind of answer it expects to get in case user input isn’t parsed correctly.
* **Check for dead-ends.** Visualization of a dialog helps ensure your bot guides user over conversation step-by-step and avoids dead-ends.


https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*eI5jlSkETgUuRXw3swHvxA.jpeg

# How to create documentation using intents:
* **Define the list of intents.** In other words, itemize all tasks users may want to accomplish or the problems users may need to solve using your chatbot.
* **Write the list of utterances for every intent.** Provide the examples of sentences your users may type or tell when referring to a specific intent.
* **Identify entities. Figure out possible entities.** Entities include the details important for the user’s intent. NLP bots extract entities from user messages to provide a relevant action or/and reply.
* **Specify a set of actions.** Build up a set of actions determined by intents, extracted entities and expected bot logics.
* **Combine everything into a table.** Create the table with intents, utterances, entities and actions to get a relevant picture of the possible user-bot conversations.


https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*OOkwHjbRyqHTgyxyWi9RBA.png


# How to create a clickable prototype:
* **Select a relevant tool.** Choosing the right tool, go for the platform built for chatbot development. This is a sure way to have all necessary actions and controls.
* **Prepare a dialogue script.** Finalize your copy and use it in the prototype.
* **Prepare graphic elements.** If you plan to use cards with images, prepare all relevant content instead of using empty or default images. This should help build more complete experience with a chatbot prototype.
* **Rely on conversation flow.** It is not necessary to create conversation flow in addition to prototype. But if you have it, at least on paper, make sure you follow all the steps.
* **Put the graphics and scripts into your tool.** If you have a clear vision of the flow and all assets, you can put everything in the tool and share it for analysis and feedback.



Sentiment Analysis and Tone Analyzer, using both or some o these techniques, can be a start point to human and machine interact with a representation comfortable to them.
* Offer a new channel to deal with unhappy users, that might be redirecting them to a human
* Better understanding the user intents
* Extract and record key and relevant feelings and emotions of users
* Share the relevant info with the right people
* Opportunity to learn from customers
* Give a new level of intelligence to the Bot

# 3 Things to Know Before Building a Bot
* Bet On One Messaging Platform
* Plan For Scaling
* Do One Thing Well



How to Document Chatbot Requirements

Conversation Flow
	conversation flow is a dialog tree.



# How to design conversation flow:
* **Consider on-boarding.** Decide how your chatbot starts its dialog and what kind of options it gives to your users.
* **Sketch a flow chart.** Create the flow for every task user can accomplish talking to you bot.
* **Pay attention to triggers.** Work on the most important part of conversation flow — conditional triggers that split the flow depending on user replies and actions.
* **Think about error handling.** Make sure your chatbot can handle any user input and suggest the kind of answer it expects to get in case user input isn’t parsed correctly.
* **Check for dead-ends.** Visualization of a dialog helps ensure your bot guides user over conversation step-by-step and avoids dead-ends.

# How to create documentation using intents:
* **Define the list of intents.** In other words, itemize all tasks users may want to accomplish or the problems users may need to solve using your chatbot.
* **Write the list of utterances for every intent.** Provide the examples of sentences your users may type or tell when referring to a specific intent.
* **Identify entities. Figure out possible entities.** Entities include the details important for the user’s intent. NLP bots extract entities from user messages to provide a relevant action or/and reply.
* **Specify a set of actions.** Build up a set of actions determined by intents, extracted entities and expected bot logics.
* **Combine everything into a table.** Create the table with intents, utterances, entities and actions to get a relevant picture of the possible user-bot conversations.

# How to create a clickable prototype:
* **Select a relevant tool.** Choosing the right tool, go for the platform built for chatbot development. This is a sure way to have all necessary actions and controls.
* **Prepare a dialogue script.** Finalize your copy and use it in the prototype.
* **Prepare graphic elements.** If you plan to use cards with images, prepare all relevant content instead of using empty or default images. This should help build more complete experience with a chatbot prototype.
* **Rely on conversation flow.** It is not necessary to create conversation flow in addition to prototype. But if you have it, at least on paper, make sure you follow all the steps.
* **Put the graphics and scripts into your tool.** If you have a clear vision of the flow and all assets, you can put everything in the tool and share it for analysis and feedback.



Sentiment Analysis and Tone Analyzer, using both or some o these techniques, can be a start point to human and machine interact with a representation comfortable to them.
* Offer a new channel to deal with unhappy users, that might be redirecting them to a human
* Better understanding the user intents
* Extract and record key and relevant feelings and emotions of users
* Share the relevant info with the right people
* Opportunity to learn from customers
* Give a new level of intelligence to the Bot

# How to Design Conversations that Influence People
But #1: which conversation should I build first?
But #2: conversation design shouldn’t be rocket science!
But #3: why not just design the conversation steps straight away!?
But #4: I don’t know what the key conversations are?!
But #5: I have very different types of customers!?

Here’s some ways to identify your key conversation topics:

* Review existing web-chats or phone call data for the top FAQs
* Look at your top web search terms or google search terms
* Brainstorm the key tasks customers and employees need/want to be able to do with your organisation

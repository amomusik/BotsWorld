# Responsive Personality Design in Chatbots


4 different Conversational User Interfaces that I wanted to explore, each with increasing level of visual interactivity.

* Voice Only 
* Text Only 
* Simple UI — buttons or other very simple UI elements
* Rich UI — image carousels, actionable UI elements (payments, etc)

## Voice

# Choosing Technologies Is The 3rd Step Of a Bot Project
1. **Identify the right use case** and the right scope with your client : sometime projects are not feasible technically, not really useful, or even too expensive. Don’t hesitate to start small and scale up !
2. **Design the conversation flows** (you can use RealtimeBoard a great collaborative mindmapping tool, or BotMock)
3. Choose the most appropriate **tech stack**
4. **Develop** in agile methodology using sprints, test with beta-users, improve the bot flow, the knowledge base, the bot personality…
5. **Scale up**, follow **analytics/KPI** and compare to objectives you want to achieve


How To Explain The Technologies Powering a Chatbot?
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*BVBQ-uiAOYB9LthbSoiUUA.png


* Users interact through a **device** on a **messaging platform**, his message is processed through **NLP**.
* Then the bot can launch an **action**, answer with realtime information from a **database/API, or handover to a human**.
* The more message he receives, the more the bot improves : it’s called **machine learning**. Sometime a human helps the bot, it’s called **supervised learning**.

19 Best UX Practices for Building Chatbots
1. Strive for consistency: don’t create expectations that the chatbot can’t meet.
2. Strive for consistency: provide a way back to the “main menu” somehow.
3. Until it becomes an established practice, don’t rely on Facebook’s persistent menu.
4. Don’t make the users go tl;dr.
5. Test your chatbot on different devices to make sure users are not scrolling to read.
6. Consistency: the key to making users feel safe to explore.
7. If you must redirect users out of Messenger, Use webviews.
8. Make your redirects relevant.
9. Use UI components as “guard rails” in a conversation.
10. Know that buttons and quick replies give an illusion of limited choices.
11. Be aware of the context of your messages.
12. Wording matters: clarity over elegance.
13. Wording matters: confirm by asking, not stating.
14. Wording matters: the response will follow the question.
15. Don’t leave the user hanging.
16. Undo and cancel as a functionality.
17. Give opportunities to fix misunderstandings consistently throughout the interactions.
18. Don’t display important texts as captions, and be mindful of pre-existing conventions.
19. Keep your humor safe and professional.

# 11 More Best UX Practices for Building Chatbots
1. Your chatbot needs a voice.
2. Be conscientious of how the representation of your chatbot affects the user experience.
3. Increase wait time with each additional message to give users time to read.
4. Make sure buttons are functional at all points of the conversation.
5. Learn when it is appropriate to employ quick replies or buttons.
6. Write quick replies from a first-person perspective—that is, as a user would respond.
7. Learn to say “no” tactfully, for the users’ sake.
8. If you‘re asking for a text input after using quick replies, remind the user to type.
9. Craft clever responses to cover all ground.
